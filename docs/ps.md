Problem Statement

A restaurant wastes money in two ways: over-resourcing (too many staff, too much food ordered, ingredients expiring) and under-resourcing (understaffed nights, unavailable dishes mid-service, angry customers). Your job is to build a system that predicts three things for any upcoming day:
1. How many covers (customers) to expect, broken down by hour.
2. How many staff to schedule, by role and station.
3. How much of each ingredient to order, accounting for shelf life and supplier lead times.
The hard part: your predictions will be wrong. The system must accept corrections from managers ("you predicted 120 covers, we actually got 85 because of rain") and adjust its coefficients over time until its predictions converge toward accuracy. This is not a one-shot model. It's a feedback loop.
